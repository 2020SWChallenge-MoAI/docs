      Return recently read books' <code>bid</code> the user who currently signed in

      * The api will conduct the job with its best effort. If the number of the book user read is smaller than <code>num</code>, it will return only <code>bid</code>s that user read. If you have to deal with the total number of the result(ex. traverse), recoommand to re-count the result, not just use <code>num</code> you provide.
