            Number of the <code>bid</code> that want to receive. Should be an integer bigger than 0. Invalid value will be ignored(fall to default). In default, it will return all books that the user read.
            The api will conduct the job with its best effort. If the number of the book the user read is smaller than <code>num</code>, it will return only <code>bid</code>s that the user read. If you have to deal with the total number of the result(ex. traverse), recoommand to re-count the result, not just use <code>num</code> you provide.
